# DynamicArray
Attempted to recreate the std::vector, this is what happened

What you can do with this:
  - store any kind of elements in it
  - store any number of elements
  - store dynamic arrays of dynamic arrays of ... etc ... of elements.
  - basic functionalities: push_back, erase, pop_back, at, clear
  
There's no reason good reason why you should use this instead of std::vector, in fact I recommend you don't.
I only made this because I thought it was good exercise.
